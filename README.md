# BookHaven Website Development Report 📚

## Project Overview 🌟

The **BookHaven** website was a collaborative effort among five individuals, including myself. Our goal was to create a platform focused on books, encompassing features for buying and exploring various literary works. The project served as a learning opportunity to delve into the integration of frontend technologies with PHP for database connectivity. Given our limited prior knowledge, the implementation was kept fairly basic.
